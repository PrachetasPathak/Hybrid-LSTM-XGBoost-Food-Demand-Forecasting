# Hybrid-LSTM-XGBoost-Food-Demand-Forecasting
Hybrid LSTM-XGBoost model for forecasting food demand using real-world supply chain data. The model leverages LSTM for temporal sequence learning and XGBoost for nonlinear feature modeling, achieving improved accuracy and reduced forecast error.

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and XGBoost model designed for accurate food demand forecasting using real-world supply chain data. The hybrid architecture leverages the temporal learning capability of LSTM with the nonlinear modeling strength of XGBoost, achieving significantly better performance compared to standalone models.

This work was developed as part of a research study focused on minimizing food waste and improving decision-making in food supply chains through predictive analytics.
